<h2>The lack of jobs in Angola</h2>

<p>Angola faces significant challenges related to job availability. Between the end of 2022 and the end of 2023, over 550,000 new workers joined the labor force, but only 10,000 jobs were added. Urban and youth unemployment rates surged to 42% and 58%, respectively, by the end of 2023, up from 39% and 53% the previous year1. This situation highlights the pressing need for policies and initiatives to promote job creation and address unemployment in the country.</p>




<h2>How the angolan youth think?</h2>

<p>Angolan youth today face a complex blend of experiences. Those born and raised in rural areas, most affected by war, grapple with conflict’s impact. Urban youth, with greater access to modernity, also confront uncertainty about their future1. Despite challenges, young people actively shape their destinies, contributing to transformation and leadership in Angola1. Efforts are underway to enhance job opportunities, entrepreneurship, and civic engagement for Angolan youth.</p>

<p>Young today is synonymous with change, progress, and shaping the future. Young people play a crucial role in society, whether consciously or not. Here are some perspectives on the role of today’s youth:</p>
<p>1.	Agents of Change: Young people are not just the future; they are key agents of change and progress. Their impact extends beyond economic development, influencing social relationships and shaping their generation’s personality.</p>
<p>2.	Global Challenges: Youth engagement is essential for addressing global challenges like the pandemic and climate change. Young individuals contribute with fresh perspectives and updated visions to daily activities, transforming reality at universities, workplaces, and other spaces.</p>
<p>3.	Education and Skills: In a rapidly changing world, young people need a mix of skills to thrive. While academic skills remain important, they are not sufficient. Access to information is increasing, and thoughtful, engaged citizens require more than memorizing facts.</p>
<p>4.	Demographics: Today, the world is home to the largest generation of young people in history, with approximately 1.2 billion individuals aged 14 to 29. Close to 90% of the world’s youth live in developing countries, where they constitute a significant proportion of the population.</p>
<p>In summary, today’s youth are actively shaping society, addressing challenges, and contributing to positive change. Their role extends beyond traditional boundaries, emphasizing the need for adaptable skills and engaged citizenship. </p>

Education and Aspirations: Youth often seek education and aspire to improve their lives. Access to quality education and vocational training is crucial for their development.
Technology and Connectivity: Like youth worldwide, Angolan youth are likely embracing technology, social media, and digital platforms. These tools can empower them but also present challenges related to privacy and misinformation.
Employment Opportunities: Youth unemployment remains a concern globally. In Angola, creating job opportunities and addressing skills gaps are essential for youth empowerment.
Social and Cultural Identity: Angolan youth may grapple with preserving cultural heritage while adapting to modern influences. Balancing tradition and progress is a common theme.
